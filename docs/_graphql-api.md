#### Queries

-   `trail(id: Int!)` — Fetch a trail record by ID.
-   `trails(from: Date!, to: Date!, ...)` — Search for trail records within a specified date range, and optionally filter by additional values.
-   `enumerateTrails(from: Date!, to: Date!, type: TrailType!, ...)` — Return an enumeration of trails of the specified type, within the specified date range.

#### Mutations

-   `insertTrail(when: Date!, who: StringWithAttrs!, what: StringWithAttrs!, subject: StringWithAttrs!, where: JSON, why: JSON, meta: JSON)` — Insert a new trail record.
-   `updateTrail(id: Int!, when: Date!, who: StringWithAttrs!, what: StringWithAttrs!, subject: StringWithAttrs!, where: JSON, why: JSON, meta: JSON)` — Update a trail record.
-   `deleteTrail(id: Int!)` — Delete a trail record.

##### String values

Some trail record fields support attributed string values (indicated by the `StringWithAttrs` type) when inserting or updating.

When writing fields of this type, the value can be specified either as an object with an `id` property (specifying the string value) and additional properties which specify the string's attributes; or as a simple string value when no additional attributes are needed:

-   String with attributes: `{ id: "the string", attr0: "this", attr1: 1 }`
-   String with no attributes: `"the string"` - equivalent to `{ id: "the string" }`

#### Usage

##### Get a trail record

```graphql
{
    trail(id: 123) {

}
```

##### Search for trail records

```graphql
{
    trails(from: "2018-01-01T12:34:56.000Z", to: "2018-01-05T12:34:56.000Z") {
      count
      data {

}
```
